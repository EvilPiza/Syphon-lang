# Syphon

*Syphon Your Time Out The Window*.

## Features (So Far)

- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, and `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `foreach`, and `while`)
- Variable declarations (mutable and immutable)
- Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `++;`, `--;`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)
- Optional static typing (You can use the `any` type to bypass)

## Confirmed Coming Soon

- Ternary operator, most of it is out but still kinda buggy
- Full rewrite (code too ugly)

## Confirmed Never Coming Soon

- Classes, functional programming is way better.

## How to work bat file (for dummies)

- Just run the `.bat` file with the parameter of your Syphon file!
- To only *Compile* Syphon and not run it just add `-c` to the end!!
- To delete the Python file after it runs add the `-d` parameter!!
