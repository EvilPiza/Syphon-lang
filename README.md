# Syphon

*Syphon Your Time Out The Window.*

## Features (So Far)

- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, and `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `foreach`, and `while`)
- Variable immutability
- Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `++;`, `--;`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)
- Optional static typing (You can use the `any` type to bypass)
- `match-find` statements! basically `match-case` but weird!!

## Coming Soon

- Full rewrite (code too ugly) (i really don't want to do this)

## How to work bat file (for dummies)

- Just run the `.bat` file with the parameter of your Syphon file!
- To only *Compile* Syphon and not run it just add `-c` to the end!! (this wont go through any error checker btw!)
- To delete the Python file after it runs add the `-d` parameter!!
