# Syphon

*Syphon: The Worst Language You Could Ever Learn*.

## Features (So Far)

- Function definitions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, and `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `foreach`, and `while`)
- Variable declarations (mutable and immutable)
- Weird function stuff (`call` keyword, read example_code.syp for clairification)
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ++;, --;)

## Confirmed Coming Soon

- Full rewrite (code too ugly)

## Confirmed Never Coming Soon

- Classes; object orientation sucks.

## How to work .bat file

- Just run the .bat file with the parameter of your Syphon file!
- Example: .\syphon.bat PythonButSlower.syp
- (I include '.\' because my machine is weird, you probably wont have to)
