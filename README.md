# Syptonic

*Something, something, something, Syptonic.*

## Features (So Far)

- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, and `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `foreach`, and `while`)
- Variable immutability
- Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `++;`, `--;`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)
- Optional static typing (You can use the `any` type to bypass)
- `match-find` statements! basically `match-case` but weird!!

## Coming Soon

- Allow one liners (rework basically everything that uses brackets :<)
- Remove useless errors (would do this now but im too busy (lazy))
- Full rewrite (code too ugly) (i really don't want to do this)

## How to work bat file (for dummies)

- Just run the `.bat` file with the parameter of your Syptonic file!
- To only *Compile* Syptonic and not run it just add `-c` to the end!!
- To delete the Python file after it runs add the `-d` parameter!!
