# Syphon

*Syphon Your Time Out The Window*.

## Features (So Far)

- Function definitions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, and `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `foreach`, and `while`)
- Variable declarations (mutable and immutable)
- Weird function stuff (`call` keyword, read example_code.syp for clairification)
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ++;, --;)

## Confirmed Coming Soon

- Ternary operator (probably going to copy js)
- Full rewrite (code too ugly)

## Confirmed Never Coming Soon

- Classes; object orientation sucks.

## How to work bat file (for dummies)

- Just run the .bat file with the parameter of your Syphon file!
- Example: `.\syphon PythonButSlower.syp` (I include " .\ " because my machine is weird, you probably wont have to)
- To only *Compile* Syphon and not run it just add `-c` to the end!!
- Example: `.\syphon ILoveSyphon.syp -c`
- To delete the Python file after it runs add the `-d` parameter!! (it almost makes Syphon look like an independant language!!)
